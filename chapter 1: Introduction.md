# The Main Components of a 5G Network :
* There three main components of the 5G network , first one is UE using this a user can connect to the 5G network , then second important component is the RAN Radio Access Network , it is called as the access network because here the UE is connects to the 5G network and this RAN may be compose of one or more gNB which stands for Next Genration NodeB and it is also known as the base station and it is preciously here the UE is connects to gNB for the wireless channel and this gNB is also invole in the Radio Resource Management , it means that gNB decides which channels is used by the UE and at what power UE is going to transmiite ,then we have the Third component 5G Core network , eg if the UE wants to connect to  the external network , in that case the user data and the user signaling passes through the core network and it is switch and routed by the 5G core network, when the UE wants to call the another UE than it has o first go to the core network and then it would be routed to the another UE . 

# Design Goals of Open RAN :
* The 60% cost of the Mobile Network is in the RAN , it consist of gNB , before Open RAN , gNB has proprietary  software , that was running on the proprietary hardware that means we have to buy this gNB form a signal vendor and scence there were very few vendors so the cost of the gNB was quite high , in the open RAN , the hardware and the software of a gNB is disaggregate in such a way that instead of proprietary hardware use the Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) hardware which is much cheaper and the interfaces b/w the various components of the gNB are Open/Standardised interface that means that we can take different component of the gNBs from different vendors we can build our own gNB , so this reduces the cost , because of the compition of the different vendors also we are save from the vendor lockin, further more scence the interfaces b/w  different gNB components or open RAN standardised , by the small third party companies also make apps using these interfaces inorder to provide innovative services to the user and the open RAN can be deploy and the cloud , on the cloud we know we can increase and decrease requirement depending upon the demands, so this reduces the Capital Expenditure which is the expenditure to set up and the operation expenditure of the network in order to operate the network also reduce.
