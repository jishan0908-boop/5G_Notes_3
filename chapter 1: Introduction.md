# The Main Components of a 5G Network :
* There three main components of the 5G network , first one is UE using this a user can connect to the 5G network , then second important component is the RAN Radio Access Network , it is called as the access network because here the UE is connects to the 5G network and this RAN may be compose of one or more gNB which stands for Next Genration NodeB and it is also known as the base station and it is preciously here the UE is connects to gNB for the wireless channel and this gNB is also invole in the Radio Resource Management , it means that gNB decides which channels is used by the UE and at what power UE is going to transmiite ,then we have the Third component 5G Core network , eg if the UE wants to connect to  the external network , in that case the user data and the user signaling passes through the core network and it is switch and routed by the 5G core network, when the UE wants to call the another UE than it has o first go to the core network and then it would be routed to the another UE .
