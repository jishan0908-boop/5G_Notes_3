* * The O-DU , O-CU-CP/UP are virtulaized on O-cloud , SMO is an intelligent automation platform that is used to manage these entities on the cloud . It is invole in the automation and the Lifecycle of these entities , these SMO has the O1 interface with these entities , and it supports the FCAP operation.
* * FCAPS is a abbreivation of 5 words :
  * 1. F = Fault detection and correction , which means SMO use O1 to detect and coreect the faults in the entities .
    2. C = Configuration and Operation , which means SMO use O1 to configur and operate these entities .
    3. A = Accounting and the Billing of these entitis also done bu SMO .
    4. P = Also the Key performance indicator are collected by O1 interface and then they are assess by the SMO .
    5. S = Security assurance and the protection , of these entities are also assure by SMO .

  * In order to manage O-Cloud , the SMO use O2 interface , and SMO also has the database which is used to collect the information , Storing the information from the another database to the SMO's database for any functionality like , any UAV uses the O-RU for the direction , so its destination in the external database , so SMO takes information from the that database and store it in it's database ,this called Enrichment information .
  * Similarly the Key Performance Inddicator of the entites , are also collected by the SMO , and store in the database .
  * SMO also has the AI/ML framework in order to run he analytics on these KPIS .
  * Than we have the open fronthaul managemaent interface , this interface is used by the SMO , in order manage the open fronthaul b/w O-RU & O-DU.
