* It already exsist perviously before the O-RAN in the UE , before O-RAN the base station monitor the UE and then information about these Monitor radio conditions were passed to the gNB then it pass to OMC in it the parameters of the cell were varied , where handover margins where changed , or the cell reselection parameter would be chnaged or the cell priorty would be changed so that UE syeer to the desire cells . The problem is that all the UE were treated same , in that case policies were not UE centric , but in the case of O-RAN we can make UE centric policy we have more fine grain control over the UE and the services they are using .
