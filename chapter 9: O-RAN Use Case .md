## Use Case NSSI Resource Allocation Optimization :
A network slice instance hav different usage patterns like different times , different location , we have different UE and the different types of Applications.
eg most of the IoT runs during the of-peak hours or during the weekends 
eg for certain Special events like sports game or concert , we know that the traffic demand at ceration times and location increases .
So the AI/ML models are used to predict the traffice demand per slice for different location and time .This AI/ML model trained using data collected form the O-RAN nodes and this data is collected form the days and weeks or months .
Inthis way
